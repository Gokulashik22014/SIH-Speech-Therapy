            Hello! I'm Dr. Jeager, a dedicated therapy supervisor with over 13
            years of experience in the mental health field. I specialize in
            providing guidance and support to therapists, ensuring high-quality
            care for clients and fostering a collaborative environment for
            professional growth. My approach focuses on evidence-based
            practices, empathy, and holistic care, helping therapists enhance
            their skills and deliver impactful therapy sessions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            I am passionate about mental health advocacy and committed to
            fostering a culture of continuous learning and development within
            therapeutic practices. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, mindfulness
            meditation, and engaging in community wellness programs.
